# SoundboardWrapper
As part of the MidiDomotica application, this application works like a separate soundboard. It is capable of playing audio files, work as throughput for your microphone using a Virtual Audio Cable like VBCable allowing you to add effects over your voice and record and save audio clips from up to a set amount of time (defaulting to 5 seconds), which can easily be controlled using the midi keyboard connected to the MidiDomotica application.
